### Personal Development

Only the files specific to this application have been included. You'll need to initiate a new Sencha Touch app with Phonegap support. You should then be able to copy over the required files into the appropriate locations.

The app was built with Sencha Touch 2.4. Download and extract Sencha Touch to ./touch directory.
